# Be-Your-Own-Bartender
This projects is a group project done by four coders to create a website application using API's of both YouTube and TheCocktailDB to create a way for someone to search drinks either by the drink name or the ingredients to find a recipe for a drink. It allows the user to become an amateur bartender by creating bar worthy drinks at your home.
